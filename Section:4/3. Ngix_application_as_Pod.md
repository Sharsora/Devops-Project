- we need to run our register app on teh kubernetes cluster so that in case if something happens to our pod or container, ot should able to reprovision. that is how we can make sure that our application haighly availble for end user.
- for this create deployment and give name to deployment and we are pulling image this is image using to create a pod this image pulled from docker hub then replicas it is going to create 2 replicas nothing but 2 pods it is going to create and it exposes on port number 80.
- Next we expose deployment as a service on port 80 and there are different service availble to expose our pod eitehr kubernetes level or external network. like Load balancer, node port, clusterIP we can use.
- However we want to access our application through browser so we use load balancer.

- Whenever we create deployment in the backend it is going to initiate a replica set and this replicaset is going to create a pod. But in our case we have mentioned 2 replicas so it create 2 pods.
- to access this pod we need to create service by using expose command. so it create service in the backend and through service we can access and this service type is load balancer that is the reason we could able to see load balancer on AWS

- now go in bootstarp server
