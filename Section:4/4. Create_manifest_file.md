- how we can create a pod and service using manifest file
- lets delete existing resources. whenever we delete deployment it delete replicasets as well as pods.
- need to delete load balancer as well because we have deleted respective deployment.
```sh
[root@ip-172-31-25-22 tmp]# kubectl delete deployment demo-nginx
deployment.apps "demo-nginx" deleted
[root@ip-172-31-25-22 tmp]# kubectl get all
NAME                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                               PORT(S)        AGE
service/demo-nginx   LoadBalancer   10.100.173.163   a19cab90f5eaf48e8be7b05aac110fa0-1375601859.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com   80:32088/TCP   30m
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.100.0.1       <none>                                                                    443/TCP        3h20m
[root@ip-172-31-25-22 tmp]#
```
```sh
[root@ip-172-31-25-22 tmp]# kubectl delete service/demo-nginx
service "demo-nginx" deleted
[root@ip-172-31-25-22 tmp]#
```

#### Refer document for creating manifest file https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.27/

- in manifest file apiversion v1, kind means what kind of resource we are creating it can be a pod, deployment, replicaset etc, next metatdata which tell us name of the pod, next labels will be helpful to assiciate with services, next specification usually whenever we create pod we need to give image right? that image name we should provide here and on which port number we need to expose our application.

```sh
apiVersion: v1                (syntax like if starts from left side and have two words like api and version so first letter of first word will samll and second work ka first letter capital)
kind: Pod                   (name of any resources should be in capital, as right side value should be in capital)
metadata: 
  name: demo-pod
  labels:
    app: demo-app

spec:
  containers:
    - name: demo-nginx
      image: nginx
      ports: 
        - name: demo-nginx
          containerPorts: 80
```
