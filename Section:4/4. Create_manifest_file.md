- how we can create a pod and service using manifest file
- lets delete existing resources. whenever we delete deployment it delete replicasets as well as pods.
- need to delete load balancer as well because we have deleted respective deployment.
```sh
[root@ip-172-31-25-22 tmp]# kubectl delete deployment demo-nginx
deployment.apps "demo-nginx" deleted
[root@ip-172-31-25-22 tmp]# kubectl get all
NAME                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                               PORT(S)        AGE
service/demo-nginx   LoadBalancer   10.100.173.163   a19cab90f5eaf48e8be7b05aac110fa0-1375601859.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com   80:32088/TCP   30m
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.100.0.1       <none>                                                                    443/TCP        3h20m
[root@ip-172-31-25-22 tmp]#
```
