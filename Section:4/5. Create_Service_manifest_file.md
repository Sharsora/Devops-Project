- to expose our pod we need a service (check service manifest file in kubernetes)

```sh
apiVersion:v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: demo-service

spec:
  ports:
  - name: nginx-port
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  
  type: LoadBalancer
```
```sh
[root@ip-172-31-25-22 tmp]# kubectl apply -f pod.yml 
pod/demo-pod created
[root@ip-172-31-25-22 tmp]#
[root@ip-172-31-25-22 tmp]# kubectl apply -f service.yml 
service/demo-service created
[root@ip-172-31-25-22 tmp]# kubectl get all

service/kubernetes     ClusterIP      10.100.0.1      <none>                                                                    443/TCP        4h11m
[root@ip-172-31-25-22 tmp]#
```

- when we check on AWS load balancer, instances status shows Outofservice why?
- because we have created pod and service, while creating service we got load balancer that load balancer we are accessing from external network. when we send request from external network to service how does it know that it has to send it to this pod only? because in cluster there could be 100 of pods. that is where we are to use labels.
- we can use label in manifest file that is key value pair. both in pod.xml and service.xml if we mention same label then it means that any requiet to comes to this service it look for the selector, this selector have label and whatever ports are having this label it is forward request to that spacific port.
