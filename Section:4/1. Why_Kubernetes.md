- We have completed this entire CI-CD pipeline and we could able to deploy application on Docker container successfully. However, in case this Docker container goes down, there is no way to recover.
- To overcome this problem, we can use Docker native service called Docker Swamp or else we can use container management service like Kubernetes. But using Kubernetes gives lot of advantages comparatively Docker Swamp. That is the reason we are not going to deploy our applications as a Docker container. We are going to deploy it as a pod on our Kubernetes environment.
- Now we need to set up our Kubernetes environment because everything is in place so that we can deploy our applications as a pod. 

- searched for Kubernetes setup on google and we got an official document that is kubernetes.io. If you see here, we have learning environment and production environment. So if I go with the what are the different ways we can set up production environment. Here again, we have different ways among them installing Kubernetes with deployment tools, turnkey cloud solutions, Windows and Kubernetes. We will be measuring using either deployment tools or turnkey cloud solutions.
- check what are the methods we have under deployment tools. Here we can set up Kubernetes by using kubeadm, kops and kubespray.
- And if we go with the turnkey cloud solutions. Here again, we have various ways that is on Microsoft, Azure, Alibaba cloud, AWS, AKS, Baidu AI cloud. Like that we have various clouds who are providing their cloud solutions to set up Kubernetes. Among this, we are going to set up our Kubernetes on AWS by using EKS. For this one, I have prepared a documentation in my GitHub repository that is Kubernetes setup using EKS CTL. EKS CTL is a utility which helps us to set up Kubernetes on Amazon EKS. Apart from this, I have two more documentations to set up Kubernetes that is Kubernetes setup using kops and Kubernetes setup using kubeadm. You can use any of these methods to set up your Kubernetes. But once it is set up, managing is same. All right, but I would like to prefer to go with the Kubernetes setup using EKS CTL.
