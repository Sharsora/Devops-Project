### Description of Project Part 1

we are going to build and deploy our application on a Tomcat server.
For this, we are going to set up a CI CD pipeline with the help of GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, and Tomcat.
By this time we don't have any environment so we are going to start with setting up your Jenkins server.
Then set up and configure Maven and Git.
Next set up the Tomcat server.
Next integrate GitHub, Maven, and Tomcat server with Jenkins.
Then we are going to create a CI CD Jenkins job and we are going to see how we can build and deploy it on your Tomcat server.
Once deployment is done we are going to test our deployment.
By this time we have an environment with Git, GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, and Tomcat.
We can able to commit our code onto GitHub and Jenkins is going to pull the code from GitHub, build with the help of Maven, and deploy it on your Tomcat server.
