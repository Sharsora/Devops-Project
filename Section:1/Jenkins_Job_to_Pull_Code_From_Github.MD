# *Jenkins Job name:* `Pull_Code_From_Github`

- create a new item.
- Job name I have given pull code from github and it is a freestyle project.
- description I am giving same as job name.
- In the source code management select Git.
 - we should provide our github repository URL.
- usually you should provide credentials in case if it is a private repository, As of now it is a public repository so there is no credentials necessity.
- we are not yet building because appropriate build configurations we haven't done so apply and save it.
