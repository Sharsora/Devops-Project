- We need to update our source code
- To update our source code, We can pull this code onto our local workstation update the code and commit it to Github.
- Once it is committed we can compile and build our code with help of maven and we can deploy it onto tomcat server

### Step 1: 
- first I need to clone my code from github to my local system, update the code and I should commit it github.
- need to clone our hello world code onto my workstation
- I would like to clone this repository into this Desktop
- I will switch onto this location on my git bash
- clone from Github, copy the repository url that should be https and go here clone it
- So we have downloaded code onto our local system and if I see hello world is there
- I see whatever files you can see in the remote server same files are cloned over here
- I would like to update index.jsp file, go back to web apps under this src main web app, here we have index.jsp so we just need to edit this file
- searching for form filling html code so go here and this kind of output we are going to get if we use the code whatever is available over here
- taking this code ok so we will just update this one in our index.jsp and save it
- run 
```git status
- git add. (Added files to staging area)
- git status 
- git commit -m "updated index.jsp file" (I am committing these files on to the local repository)
- git push origin master (Now I am committing these changes on to the remote repository, so we are pushing the code on to remote repository) ```
