- we have executed BuildandDeployonContainer job, with the help of this job we could build and copy the artifacts on to dockerhost. From there to create container we have executed commands like docker build and docker run manully.we want to automate end to end pipeline
- once we commit our code onto Github it should able to build it and create artifacts and copy artifacts on docker host, creating docker image and create docker container
- for that updating existing job BuildandDeployContainer - go to configure - in the Post Build Action - send build artifacts over SSH
- here we can execute some of commands

- once the artifacts get copid, jenkins job itself going to create image and creating a container. For that add Docker command in Post Build Action - send build artifacts over SSH - Exec commands

```sh
cd /opt/docker;
docker build -t regapp:v1 .;  (do not forgot add . otherwise it will fail)
docker run -d --name registrationapp -p 8086:8080 regapp:v1
```
- now build the jenkins job , you will get war files and image created, container created

- Will update Hello-World program, so jenkins job trigger automatically without any manual intervention.
- Go to git bash, go to the path in local system

```sh
/Users/sharsora/Desktop/Project-1/hello-world/webapp/src/main/webapp
vi index.jsp
edit something here

git status
git add .
git commit -m "updated index.jsp file"
git push origin main

- job should get triggered automatically.
