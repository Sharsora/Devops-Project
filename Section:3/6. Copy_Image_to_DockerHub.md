- To commit image we need to login dockerhub account from ansible system
```sh
docker login

username & password of dockerhub
```
- in the real world we may not use docker hub we can create our own docker registries in our local system like jFrog artifactory or elase amazon docker registry anything we can use it will just hold your image. but security reason we can create docker registry in our local systems are similar kind of docker hub registry we can push images so that it can available to us.
- if we push any docker image onto docker host we can not do it directly. lets try
```sh
[ansadmin@ansible-server docker]$ docker push regapp:latest
The push refers to repository [docker.io/library/regapp]

```
- it does not recognised on which account we want to push this image, that is why we need to provide username prefix to our image.
- we will use tags.
```sh
docker tag image-id username/imagename:latest
[ansadmin@ansible-server docker]$ docker tag 841569f33f73 shivangidodia1/regapp:latest
[ansadmin@ansible-server docker]$ docker images
REPOSITORY              TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
regapp                  latest    841569f33f73   3 hours ago   472MB
registrationapp         v1        841569f33f73   3 hours ago   472MB
shivangidodia1/regapp   latest    841569f33f73   3 hours ago   472MB
[ansadmin@ansible-server docker]$ docker push
```
- if you see one more image created iwth username/regapp
- now i can commit this on dockerhub
```sh
docker push shivangidodia1/regapp:latest
```
