- here we will intergret Jenkins with ansible, so that jenkins will copy artifacts on to ansible system, ansible able to create image and deploy conainer on docker host.
- by this jenkins can do build activities and ansible wil;l do deployment activities.
- now we need to add jenkins configure system and add ansible system details (user created , enable passwordbase authentication, and publish over ssh plugin already there in jenkins)

### Integration between Docker-host and Jenkins

Install "publish Over SSH"
 - `Manage Jenkins` > `Manage Plugins` > `Available` > `Publish over SSH`

Enable connection between Docker-host and Jenkins

- `Manage Jenkins` > `Configure System` > `Publish Over SSH` > `SSH Servers` 

	- SSH Servers:
                - Name: `ansible-host`
		- Hostname:`<ServerIP>`
		- username: `ansadmin`
               
       -  `Advanced` > chose `Use password authentication, or use a different key`
		 - password: `*******`

 ### Steps to create "Copy_Artifacts_onto_Ansible" Jenkin job
 
 #### From Jenkins home page select "New Item"
   - Enter an item name: `Copy_Artifacts_onto_Ansible`
     - Copy from: `BuildandDeploy_Container`

   - *Source Code Management:*
      - Repository: `[https://github.com/yankils/hello-world.git](https://github.com/Sharsora/hello-world.git)`
      - Branches to build : `*/main`  
   -                 *Poll SCM* :      - `* * * *` (Diable it as of now)

   - *Build:*
     - Root POM:`pom.xml`
     - Goals and options: `clean install`
    
 - *Post-build Actions*
   - Send build artifacts over SSH
     - *SSH Publishers*
      - SSH Server Name: `ansible-server`
       - `Transfers` >  `Transfer set`
            - Source files: `webapp/target/*.war`  (which files we would like to upload)
	       - Remove prefix: `webapp/target`
	       - Remote directory: `//opt//docker`     (Need to create this path in ansible-server. and make ansadmin:asnadmin permission to docker directory)
         - Exec Commands
             ```sh
             (remove commands from here)
             ```

- apply and save. nad build job
- job successful
- webapp.war will be copied in asnadmin@ansible-server /opt/docker directory
- means artifacts got copied onto ansible, Now ansible job is creating image using webapp.war and push it into docker.hub
- why need to push image into docker hub, you can see the problesm to copy into different system
