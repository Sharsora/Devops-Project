- So far we have intergrated Ansible with Jenkins, so that jenkins copy artifacts, with those artifacts we have created docker image by using manul commands
- this image is available on Ansible system.

How can I make it availble to target system menas Docker-Host?
- that is where docker hub comms into picture
- we can push image onto docker hub. and this docker hub can be accessible by any docker system
- From ansible we can instruct our docker-host that go and pull the image from docker hub and create container
- we will create ansible playbook which create docker image. After that we are going to enhancer ansible playbook even further to add tags commit into docker hub so that it will be avaible for our containerisation environment.

### Create Ansible Playbook
- login to ansible server as ansadmin
- When you use ansible-playbook command you have to mentioned where is the inventory situated. if you donâ€™t specify -i it will take default inventory
- default inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts, whatever server IP mentioned in this file, on that sever playbook will execute.
- here in our case, IP mentioned in /etc/ansible/hosts that is docker host IP and we want to run ansible playbook on ansible server
- for that we should add ansible server IP to that default inventory file /etc/ansible/hosts and menetion in playbook to execute only on ansible server
- whatever we mentioned in this braces it is a group, whenever I give ansible while executing my ansible playbook it take this IP, whenever I mention dockerhost while execute it will run on dockerhost, if we have multiple IP then it will run on all those systems


```sh
sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts

[dockerhost]
172.31.28.126

[ansible]
172.31.23.183
```
- To make work with ansible you should copy ssh keys on to ansible server itself otherwise you can communicate with system.
- If I run without copying keys, it will run on dockerhost but will give error for ansibleserver

```sh
ansible all -a uptime

[ansadmin@ansible-server docker]$ ansible all -a uptime

- Verify dock host's key has been copied in to ansible
```sh
   Copy keys onto all ansible managed hosts (on Control node)
  
   ssh-copy-id ansadmin@<target-server>  (dockerhost IP)
```

- Now run ansible playbook
```sh
[ansadmin@ansible-server docker]$ ansible all -a uptime

- Now creating ansible-playbook
- hosts nothing but on which system you want to execute, if give all this playbook will run on all hosts. here i mentioned ansible in hosts it means in the host file there is group called ansible whatever mentioned under that group on that location this playbook will execute
- name: playbook will consider name as description 
- command module help us to execute linux commands as it is. if you are creqting ansible playbook somewhere else and you want to give path of Docker file then you sould use -f option
- aegs means if we move this file to some other location still we want to execute this ansible playbook without error for that we use args
  
```sh
vi regapp.yml

---        (to start ansible playbook start with three dash)
- hosts: ansible
  tasks:
  - name: create docker image
    command: docker build -t regapp:latest .   ( . means in this current directory, )
    args:
     chdir: /opt/docker     (which means if playbook is availble in any directory you can execute above docker build command in this directory /opt/docker)
```
```sh
[ansadmin@ansible-server docker]$ ansible-playbook regapp.yml --check
