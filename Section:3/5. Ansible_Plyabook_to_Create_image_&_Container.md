- So far we have intergrated Ansible with Jenkins, so that jenkins copy artifacts, with those artifacts we have created docker image by using manul commands
- this image is available on Ansible system.

How can I make it availble to target system menas Docker-Host?
- that is where docker hub comms into picture
- we can push image onto docker hub. and this docker hub can be accessible by any docker system
- From ansible we can instruct our docker-host that go and pull the image from docker hub and create container
- we will create ansible playbook which create docker image. After that we are going to enhancer ansible playbook even further to add tags commit into docker hub so that it will be avaible for our containerisation environment.
