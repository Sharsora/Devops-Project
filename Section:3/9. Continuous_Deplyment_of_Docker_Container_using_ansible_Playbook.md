- we are trying to create ansibleplaybook which can able to deply container on docker host
- if we use the earlier created one then its throwing an error, why because the container is exist on docker host we can not able to create new container.
- To overcome this remove existing container and image ,whay we need to remove? because if image present on your local system it won't go to docker hub to pull latest image that is why remove
- create new container
- once this is done we will add this deployment ansible playbook to Jenkins so jenkins take care of continuous integrations and continuous deployment of our containers.

```sh
---
- hosts: dockerhost

  tasks:
  - name: stop existing container
    command: docker stop regapp-server

  - name: remove the container
    command: docker rm regapp-server

  - name: remove image
    command: shivangidodia1/regapp:latest

  - name: create container
    command: docker run -d --name regapp-server -p 8082:8080 shivangidodia1/regapp:latest
```


- We can use docker_modules to write this ansible playbook, in google docker image module for ansible you will get modules and how to use all this instructions
- to use that we need to configure ansible to use this modules

#### updating jenkins job "Copy_Artifacts_onto_Ansible"
 - *Post-build Actions*
   - Send build artifacts over SSH
         - Exec Commands
             ```sh
             ansible-playbook /opt/docker/regapp.yml;
             sleep 10
             ansible-playbook /opt/docker/deploy_regapp.yml
             ```     

- update source code index.jsp and it will automate the procecss



- we have configure jenkins job in such a way that if some body modified code it shopuld automatically build the code create image & container and we could access change in browser.
- But if you see the problem when ever there are some changes we are terminating existing container and creating new container. During this time end user can not able to access the application another thing is if container is terminated how we can come to know if it not working or how we can create new container automatically
- that is where container management comes into pitcure.
