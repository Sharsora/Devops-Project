- Here we are going to add Dockerhost to Ansible as Managed node. So that Ansible control node can manage dockerhost. because image is build we need to initialise dockerhost to create container. that we are going to do with ansible contrl node. we will write playbook that playbook tell to our docker host how to create container.

1. On the Docker host
   - need to create ansadmin       (with this ansadmin user ansible going to manage dockerhost)
   - add ansadmin to sudoers file
   - Enable password based authentication
2. On Ansible Node
   - add to hosts file
   - Copy ssh keys  (we will copy ansible server public key onto dockerhost ansadmin user so that password less authentication enabled)
   - Test the connections   (check uptime of dockerhost) 
   
add to hosts file
```sh
vi /etc/ansible/hosts

add IP of dockerhost
```
Copy keys onto all ansible managed hosts (on Control node)
   ```sh 
   ssh-copy-id ansadmin@<target-server>
   ```

in docker host verify
```sh
[ansadmin@dockerhost .ssh]$ cat authorized_keys 
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCxGmmGX8VXnEHE7JrfSoA9pGdMIhAOGJVm1rVY0Uu3IXYGlMVMCANI+0avdwTh79FCFO6yfZ8EK88nQUQXJWEUCqsgcO8KCwm6iRZBRNB5xVhpFodYMJCccakLcb1+ZiKi67zzuGiSPzHU5K03qO6AJE5L32EY7df+Hguh9hfLoHnu7oAjEIPd+2w3GPXPETh7Q3rBahLjYCuwy4Vm5/vlNdgtpsaK7EZW09zEFVYNxBOXtXjaHzs9KjWeVrAMWczTRSmxgiuKMhkoyICVkxysh3b+Wa6EvxBBI6Xl94C3N5pFHWnVZUf6CosHwkFwgOgH+YfazMMkcE5vjQPKumcx ansadmin@ansible-server
[ansadmin@dockerhost .ssh]$ pwd
/home/ansadmin/.ssh
[ansadmin@dockerhost .ssh]$
```

Testing on Ansible server
```sh
[ansadmin@ansible-server ~]$ ansible all -m ping
[WARNING]: Platform linux on host 172.31.3.168 is using the discovered Python interpreter at /usr/bin/python, but
future installation of another Python interpreter could change this. See
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more information.

}
[ansadmin@ansible-server ~]$
```

to test from Ansible server
```sh
[ansadmin@ansible-server ~]$ ansible all -m command -a uptime

```

- now ansible communicate with dockerhost without credential nothing but passwordless authentication.
