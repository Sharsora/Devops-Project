- Setup EC2 instance
- Setup hostname
- create ansadminuser
- Add user to sudoers file
- Generate ssh keys  ( we will use key based authentication )
- Enable Password based authentication
- install ansible

1. Create a user called ansadmin (on Control node and Managed host)  
   ```sh
   useradd ansadmin
   passwd ansadmin
   ```
1. Below command grant sudo access to ansadmin user. But we strongly recommended using "visudo" command if you are aware vi or nano editor.  (on Control node and Managed host)
   ```sh
   echo "ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
   ```
   
1. Log in as a ansadmin user on master and generate ssh key (on Control node)
   ```sh 
   sudo su - ansadmin
   ssh-keygen
   ```
4. Enable Password based authentication
   ```sh
   [root@ansible-server ~]# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
   [root@ansible-server ~]#
    change like this
   
    # To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    #PermitEmptyPasswords no
    #PasswordAuthentication no
   [root@ansible-server ~]# service sshd reload
   Redirecting to /bin/systemctl reload sshd.service
   [root@ansible-server ~]#
   ```
   
1. Copy keys onto all ansible managed hosts (on Control node)
   ```sh 
   ssh-copy-id ansadmin@<target-server>
   ```
1. Install python and python-pip      (by default amazon linux 2 ami have python installed, if you work on another then need to install python)
   ```sh
   yum install python
   yum install python-pip
   ```
1. Install ansible using pip check for version
    ```sh
    pip install ansible
   ansible --version
   ```
   ```sh
   amazon-linux-extras install ansible2
   ```
