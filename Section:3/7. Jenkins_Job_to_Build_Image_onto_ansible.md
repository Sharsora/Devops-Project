- we have seen how to commit image on dockerhubwe have executed manual steps, before exectuting we have changes image name with username, then we have used docker push command to puch the image onto docker hub. I would like to incorporat this changing through ansible playbook so that i no need to do it manually.

- Update ansible playbook
```sh
vi regapp.yml

---
- hosts: ansible

  tasks:
  - name: Create docker image
    command: docker build -t regapp:latest .
    args:
     chdir: /opt/docker

  - name: create tag to push the image onto dockerhub
    command: docker tag regapp:latest shivangidodia1/regapp:latest   (same tag so that it get updated over there, it does not require any path we can execute command from anywhere so not reuire args)

  - name: push docker image
    command: docker push shivangidodia1/regapp:latest     (by this we could commit image to remote repo)
```
- make sure which user you are running ansible-playbook, with the same user you should login to dockerhub.
- creating image should happenedn only on ansible server.  that is the reason in the playbook host= ansible group
- this is how we cab restrict to execute this playbook on ansible. If you want to specify explicitly we can use limits
