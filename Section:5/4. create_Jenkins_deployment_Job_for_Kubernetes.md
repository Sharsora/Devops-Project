- We rae going to use of jenkins rather than executing those playbook from ansible.
- this job just exxecute this ansible playbook commands
- I will create jenkins job, that is deployment job, it initialise ansible playbook to initialise deploy and service files on kubernetes.

#### new jenkins job called Deploy_On_Kubernetes

- not required any build job so seleted free style project 
- mentioned same description
- we dont require git just select post build actions

Send build artifacts over SSH
 - SSH Server
    ansible-server

      - Exec Commands
             ```sh
             ansible-playbook -i /opt/docker/hosts /opt/docker/kube_deploy.yml;
             ansible-playbook -i /opt/docker/hosts /opt/docker/kube_service.yml 
             ```
   apply & Save
- buil job and it success

- Instaed of running it as two playbooks, I will just merg the content of kube_deploy.yml and kube_service.yml
```sh
[root@ip-172-31-26-3 tmp]# ll

[root@ip-172-31-26-3 tmp]#
```

```sh
[ansadmin@ansible-server docker]$ cat kube_deploy.yml 
---
- hosts: kubernetes
#  become: true
  user: root

  tasks:
  - name: deploy regapp on kuberenetes
    command: kubectl apply -f /tmp/regapp-deployment.yml

  - name: create service for regapp
    command: kubectl apply -f /tmp/service.yml
```

- Build the job and it successfully
- now we can see deployment is working as expected
- we are going to build the code and will the deployment whether it is goingto replace our pods or not
