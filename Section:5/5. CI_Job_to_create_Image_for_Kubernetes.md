- If there is any changes to our source we need to build that job and it should create latest image over docker hub and with that latest image we need to deploy our pods that is the intention.
- i would like to update the image in docker hub that is shivangidodia1/regapp by changing the source code so that kubernetes should apply with latest code
- as of now we have created only CD job which only create deployments, we need to create CI job
- just rename Deploy_On_Kubernetes as a RegApp_CD_Job
- in the CI job we just need to pull code from github hello-world and build in the jenkins and run ansible playbook in ansible server that is create_image_regapp.yml because it is going to create image adding tags and pushing to docker hub

```sh

- hosts: ansible

  tasks:
  - name: Create docker image
    command: docker build -t regapp:latest .
    args:
     chdir: /opt/docker

  - name: create tag to push the image onto dockerhub
    command: docker tag regapp:latest shivangidodia1/regapp:latest

  - name: push docker image
    command: docker push shivangidodia1/regapp:latest
```

- it is going to create latest image with help of webapp.war & Dockerfile and it commits on to hub.docker.com
- we have jenkins job `Copy_artifacts_onto_Ansible`, this will get executed whenever there is any change in source code
- now I am going to create CI job with help of that job so that we can create image and I will disable this job.

- go to jenkins UI
  
#### create new job with name as RegApp_CI_Job and copy from `Copy_artifacts_onto_Ansible` job

- Send build artifacts over SSH
     - Exec command:
          ansible-playbook /opt/docker/create_image_regapp.yml;
- deploymnt we are doing on kubernetes with other job

- updateing index.jsp file
