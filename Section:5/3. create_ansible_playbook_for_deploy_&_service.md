- execute deployment and service file using ansible
- for that need to create ansible playbook for deployment and service

- we are going to execute this playbook on kubernetes cluster that is the reason we need to add bootstarp server IP address, instead of IP we can add kuberenete because we have addedd our bootstarp server IP under kubernetes group in hosts file. Also would like to run this playbook as root so add become:true
```sh
[ansadmin@ansible-server docker]$ cat kube_deploy.yml

---
- hosts: kubernetes
  # become: true
  user: root

  tasks:
  - name: deploy regapp on kuberenetes
    command: kubectl apply -f /tmp/regapp-deployment.yml
```

```sh
[ansadmin@ansible-server docker]$ cat kube_service.yml

---
- hosts: kubernetes
  # become: true
  user: root

  tasks:
  - name: deploy regapp on kuberenetes
    command: kubectl apply -f /tmp/regapp-service.yml
```
- now run the playbook so target environment should create pods and service
- on the bootstarp server delete the file regapp-deployment.yml and service.yml
- remove all reasources and verify by kubectl get all nothing should be there. now run the playbook on ansible server
- also copy ssh keys to root user, set the root password on bootstarp server by passwd root

```sh
ssh-copy-id root@172.31.26.3
```
  
```sh
ansible-playbook -i /opt/docker/hosts kube_deploy.yml

ansible-playbook -i /opt/docker/hosts kube_service.yml 
```
- Verify on boot starp server by running
```sh
[root@ip-172-31-26-3 tmp]# kubectl get all
