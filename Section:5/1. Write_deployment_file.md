- why we want to use kubernetes is, incase some failures happes to our workloads or microservices this kubernets able to re create that resource.
- we have created a part some time back and let me try to delete it and we will see whether Kubernetes could able to create this resource again or not.
```sh
[root@ip-172-31-26-3 tmp]# kubectl delete pod demo-pod
pod "demo-pod" deleted
[root@ip-172-31-26-3 tmp]#
```
- If we delete or if pod get terminated, there is no way it is going to recreate by default. So how we can overcome this problem?
- Yes, of course, we need to do some changes to the way of using our manifest files. That is where we can use deployments.
- we have tried to deploy few applications by using the kubectl command with the deployment option. Same thing we can use it as a manifest file.

```sh
vi regapp-deployment.yml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: shiv-regapp
  labels:
    app: regapp

spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector: 
    matchLabels:
      app: regapp

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: regapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: regapp
        image: shiv/regapp
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
```
