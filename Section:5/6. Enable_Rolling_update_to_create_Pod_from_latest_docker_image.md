- we are changing code on our workstation, and this changes commiting on github reporsitory, from there jenkins is pullinhg the code and building with help of maven, and it is generating a war file we call it as artifacts and pushing it on ansible server. at the same time it is also executing ansible playbook ich can create an image with artifacts and commit it into docker hub repository. Also we have created one more job that is CD job, can be initialised by jenkins and it going to initialise ansible playbook. this ansible playbook executes deploymenet and service files on kubernetes cluster.
- we are trying to integrate CI and CD job so that whenever we do some changes over index.jsp file it should be availble on the kuberenetes cluster.

- on the jenkins UI, we have Regapp_CI_Job, in that there a option to initialise another jenkins job that is where we tell that iniatlise CD job. so that once CI job completed CD job is going to take that image and do the deployments.

#### Updating Regapp_CI_Job
   - Post-build Action
      - Add Post build Action
         - Build other projects
       
      - now scroll a littel up
      - Build other projects
         - Trigger only if build is stable
            - Projects to Build
               - RegApp_CD_Job (mention this)
             
  Save and Apply

  - now doing change in index.jsp and then it should chnage on kubernetes cluster.

- when I checked in kubernetes cluster
```sh
kuberctl get all

it shows last updated pods and service 15 hours ago
```
- It could not able recognise untill unless we do changes to our deployment and service file
- that is where we need to add one more entry
- add below into our playbook

   - name: update deployment with new pods if image updated in docker hub
    command: kubectl rollout restart deployment.apps/shiv-regapp

- this is going to replace our environment with latest image
- so now go and change index.jsp and see changes on kubernetes cluster.


- what we need to monitor while this job running.
- whenever we commit new changes, that should be updated on Git hub hello-world repo, as of now 28 commits, we could able to see 29 commits, in a while RegApp_CI_Job should initiated whenever it is running it should able to replace war file wih latest time stamp and this image should get commit over Docker hub with latest time stamp, once this is done RegApp_CD_Job should get execute that is job number 12 and this CD job should able to terminate pods one by one (which are running on bootstarp server can able see by command kubectl get all) and should able to launch the new pods with new application
