- we are changing code on our workstation, and this changes commiting on github reporsitory, from there jenkins is pullinhg the code and building with help of maven, and it is generating a war file we call it as artifacts and pushing it on ansible server. at the same time it is also executing ansible playbook ich can create an image with artifacts and commit it into docker hub repository. Also we have created one more job that is CD job, can be initialised by jenkins and it going to initialise ansible playbook. this ansible playbook executes deploymenet and service files on kubernetes cluster.
- we are trying to integrate CI and CD job so that whenever we do some changes over index.jsp file it should be availble on the kuberenetes cluster.
