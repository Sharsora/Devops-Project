- Integreat kuberbetes with Ansible because I can not run kubectl commands manually. I will tell to Ansible run kubectl commands whenever we want new deployment. that is how we can use ansible to deploy latest application on kubernetes cluster.
- we are managing our kubernetes with boot strap image that is the reason we are going to integreat with boot starp image only not with cluster.

On Bootstarp server
- create ansadmin
- Add ansadmin to sudoers files
- Enable Password based authentication

On Ansible server
- add this server to hosts file (inventory file)
- copy ssh keys
- test the connection


####
- login to bootstrap server
```sh
[root@ip-172-31-26-3 ~]# useradd ansadmin
[root@ip-172-31-26-3 ~]# passwd ansadmin
[root@ip-172-31-26-3 ~]# visudo

## Allow root to run any commands anywhere 
root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL
ansadmin ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL       (ADDed this line)
```
```sh
[root@ip-172-31-26-3 ~]# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
PasswordAuthentication yes                                          (uncomment this line)
#PermitEmptyPasswords no
#PasswordAuthentication no                                           (comment this line)

[root@ip-172-31-26-3 ~]# service sshd reload
Redirecting to /bin/systemctl reload sshd.service
[root@ip-172-31-26-3 ~]# 
```

- on ansible server
- add ip of bootstarp server on to hosts file in ansible

```sh
[ansadmin@ansible-server docker]$ cat hosts 
[kubernetes]
172.31.26.3

[ansible]
172.31.23.183

localhost
```
- to copy ssh keys
```sh
[ansadmin@ansible-server docker]$ ssh-copy-id 172.31.26.3
```
